Developer Note
--------------
This is the first time I use "GitHub" and "MarkDown" languare.  I am also confused with the purpose between "repository" and "project".  There should be one "repository" contains many different "projects".  If one "repository" represent one "project" then the naming of **UdaCity-Project** will be too general.  I will correct it if necessary.
